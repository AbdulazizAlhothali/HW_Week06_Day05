# Movie Project
---
## Part One - Display and Search Movie.
---
- Create an application that displays information about movies getting from [The Movie DB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).
- Your application will get the popular movies from this JSON: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/popular?api_key=PUT_YOUR_KEY&language=en-US&page=1
- Your application supports search for a specific movie, so you need this JSON for this purpose: https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=PUT_YOUR_KEY&language=en-US&page=1&include_adult=false
- Also, your application will save the last search did it by the user.

> Note: You need to generate a API Key and replace the `PUT_YOUR_KEY` in URL with your key. You can find how to generate it in this [video link].(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf45f5cW6c4) 


> You can see JSON data in an organized way by using [Online Json Viewer.](http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/)
